# Introduction

This project showcases how to analyze the Digital Music Store Database. I have examined the dataset with SQL and helped the store understand its business growth by answering simple and complex questions based on geographical growth, purchase power, total revenue, genre performance, music band popularity, best city in terms of revenue and best customer in terms of purchase rate. This analysis will provide great insight to the stakeholders to take proper and effective decisions.

# Database and Tools:
1. PostgreSQL (PgAdmin4)
2. Microsoft SQL Server
3. Microsoft PowerPoint

# Objectives of the Project
 1. Identify the senior most employees based on their job title.
 2. Determine the countries with the highest number of invoices.
 3. Identify the top three values of total invoices.
 4. Analyze the city with the most valuable customers and highest revenue.
 5. Display the city name and the sum of all invoice totals.
 6. Analyze the best customer and the individual who has spent the most money.
 7. Identify the genre of all rock music listeners.
 8. Determine the artist who has written the most rock music in the dataset.
 9. Analyze the most popular genre for each country.
10. Determine the customers who have spent the most on music in each country.

  # Key Findings

*Top Customers*: By analyzing customer purchase history and expenditure, identified  top customers based on their lifetime value and frequency of purchases. This information can be utilized to develop personalized marketing strategies, loyalty programs, and special offers to further engage and retain these valuable customers.

*Revenue by Country*: By aggregating sales data and analyzing customer locations, determined the top revenue-generating countries for our digital music store. This insight enables us to focus our marketing efforts, localization strategies, and customer support resources on these regions to maximize revenue potential.

*Popular Genres*: By examining customer preferences and purchase patterns, identified the most popular music genres among our customer base. This information can inform our content curation strategy, promotional campaigns, and collaborations with artists in those genres to cater to customer demands effectively.
